# Quick Start Guide

First off, thank you for considering contributing to our Slackbot! It's people like you that make Operation Code such a great community.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

We're an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into the Slackbot itself.

# Your First Contribution

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:
If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

# Getting started

#### Installation
##### Python
- Clone this repository
    - `git clone https://github.com/OperationCode/operationcode_pyback.git`
- (Optional, but recommended) Create a new virtual environment using something like [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) or [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- Install dependencies
    - In the root project directory: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

##### Slack
As most of our functionality deals with interactions with the slack API the easiest way to setup a development environment is to create a test Slack Workspace.

- Click the `Get Started` button on https://slack.com
- Click `Create a new workspace`
- Create your workspace
- Go to https://api.slack.com/
    - sign in to your workspace if you aren't already
-  Click Your Apps in the upper right
- Select Create New App
    - Enter the App name and select your development workspace

At this point you'll need a few pieces of information to correctly configure the application.
- First create a file `.env` in the root folder of your pyback directory
- Click the `Install App` tab under settings and install the app to your workspace
- Find the following in your slack app
    - `OAuth Access Token` on the Install App page
    - `Verification Token` on the Basic Information page
- Enter the tokens into your .env file in the form on
    - `DEV_BOT_TOKEN = '[Oauth token]'`
    - `DEV_AUTH_TOKEN = '[verification token]'`

Here's where things get a bit tricky.  You need to find the ID of the channel you want the bot to post messages to.
To do this we're going to use the Slack API, particularly the [channels.list](https://api.slack.com/methods/channels.list) method.

There are a few different ways you can accomplish this.
You can use a tool like curl or [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) to interact with the API directly, or you can use the python Slack client.

Before making any requests, go to `OAuth & Permissions`, click `Select Permissions Scopes` under `Scopes`, and
select `Access information about user's public channels` under the `Channels` tab.

###### Postman

###### Python Terminal and Slack Client
![channels](/images/channelsWithClient.png)

Add the channel id to your .env file as `DEV_PRIVATE_CHANNEL = '[channel-id]'`

Go ahead and run the `run.py` file, the server should successfully start.

The only thing left to do is configure a public facing URL that slack can use to send events.
You could use a hosting service to accomplish this but we frequently use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to create a temporary URL that forwards
all traffic to your localhost.

After downloading ngrok create a temporary url on port 5000 using `ngrok http 5000` (or a similar command depending on your OS and where you saved the file)

You'll something like the below image.

We now need to tell Slack to send all events to your forwarding URL.

Back in the Slack App console select the `Event Subscription` tab and click the enable events slider.

Our app is listening for events at the `/event_endpoint` url, so our request URL is `[ngrok url]/event_endpoint`

Similarly for the interactive components, our app is listening at `/user_interaction` and `/options_load`

# Other Notes

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist, you are probably not alone! There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that we have today were added because our users saw the need. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

For any other questions, you can chat with our team on the operationcode.org Slack, in #oc-projects.
